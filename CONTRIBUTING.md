# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we will need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

Here are some important resources:

  * [TBD](http://) TBD.

## Testing
To develp and test, install locally a LAMP distribution such as XAMPP, 
and install the application with the default schema for testing.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to ecadms](https://github.com/ecadms/ecadms/pull/new/master)
with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). 
When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include RSpec examples. We can always use more test coverage. 
Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Most of the code is generated by the Rapid Application Development (RAD) tool we used.
If added code is required, look at existing code and use similar convention.

Thanks,
Phil Durocher, contributor
